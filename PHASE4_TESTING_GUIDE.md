## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

**Solution:** Make sure backend was restarted after implementation

### **Issue: Voucher number not showing**
**Solution:** Check backend API is responding at `/vouchers/next-number/JOURNAL`

### **Issue: Accounts not loading**
**Solution:** Run `npm run seed:accounts` to create initial accounts

### **Issue: "401 Unauthorized" on API calls**
**Solution:** 
1. Check you're logged in
2. Verify JWT token in localStorage
3. Restart backend to ensure JwtAuthGuard is loaded

### **Issue: Trial balance not balanced**
**Solution:** This would indicate a bug - please report with:
- Voucher details
- Expected vs actual balances
- Screenshot of trial balance

### **Issue: Running balance calculation wrong**
**Solution:** This would indicate a bug in balance calculation logic - please report
