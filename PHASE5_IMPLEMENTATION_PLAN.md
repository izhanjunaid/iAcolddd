   - Stock tracking by customer
   - **TODO: Add CustomersModule before starting Phase 5!**

2. **Accounts (Phase 3)**
   - Labour/carriage charges post to GL accounts
   - Future: Rental invoices will post to accounts

3. **Vouchers (Phase 4)**
   - GRN approval creates accounting vouchers
   - GDN approval creates accounting vouchers

---

## üìù Business Rules to Implement

### 1. GRN Rules:
- [ ] GRN number auto-increment (format: GRN-YYYY-NNNN)
- [ ] Net weight = Gross weight - Tare weight (must be > 0)
- [ ] Amount = Quantity √ó Rate (reference only, not for billing)
- [ ] Grace days default from customer settings (can be overridden)
- [ ] Labour can be charged to customer or default expense account
- [ ] Ownership date defaults to GRN date (critical for billing calculation)
- [ ] Each GRN detail line assigned to specific Room + Rack
- [ ] Cannot edit/delete approved GRN

### 2. Stock Rules:
- [ ] Stock created only after GRN approval
- [ ] Stock tracked at GRN detail level (lot-based tracking)
- [ ] Stock balance = GRN quantity - GDN quantities
- [ ] Multiple lots of same product can be in different locations
- [ ] Stock must be available before GDN approval

### 3. GDN Rules:
- [ ] GDN number auto-increment (format: GDN-YYYY-NNNN)
- [ ] Can only deliver stock that exists for the customer
- [ ] Delivered quantity cannot exceed available stock
- [ ] GDN detail references specific GRN detail (lot tracking)
- [ ] Cannot edit/delete approved GDN
- [ ] Stock reduced only after GDN approval

### 4. Transfer Rules:
- [ ] Can only transfer stock that exists at source location
- [ ] Destination must have capacity
- [ ] Transfer updates stock location (room/rack)
- [ ] Transfer history maintained for audit

2. **Auto-calculations** - Net weight, amounts
3. **Smart Selectors** - Customer, product, room, rack with search
4. **Real-time Validation** - Stock availability, capacity checks
5. **Status Badges** - Draft, Approved, Delivered
6. **Approval Workflow** - Clear approve/reject actions
7. **Stock Visualization** - Charts showing inventory by location/product

- [ ] Validation rules

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] GRN approval workflow
- [ ] GDN approval workflow
- [ ] Stock balance calculations

- [ ] Complete GDN flow (create ‚Üí approve ‚Üí verify stock reduction)
- [ ] Inter-room transfer flow
- [ ] Stock reports accuracy

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Prerequisites

### **BLOCKER: Customers Module Missing!**

Phase 5 requires a **CustomersModule** (not yet implemented). This must be added first!

**Recommended Approach:**
- **Option A:** Add simplified CustomersModule as Phase 4.5 (3-4 days)
- **Option B:** Use existing Accounts module for customers temporarily
- **Option C:** Build CustomersModule as part of Phase 5 (Week 1)

**Recommendation:** Go with **Option C** - build CustomersModule in Week 1 alongside ProductsModule.

## üìä Estimated Effort

| Module | Backend | Frontend | Testing | Total |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Products | 1.5 days | 1.5 days | 0.5 days | 3-4 days |
| Warehouses | 2.5 days | 2.5 days | 1 day | 5-6 days |
| GRN | 5 days | 5 days | 2 days | 10-12 days |
| Stock | 2.5 days | 2.5 days | 1 day | 5-6 days |
| GDN | 4 days | 4 days | 2 days | 8-10 days |
| Transfers | 2 days | 2 days | 1 day | 4-5 days |
| Reports | 2 days | 2.5 days | 0.5 days | 5-6 days |
| **Total** | **19.5 days** | **20 days** | **8 days** | **~40-45 days (6-7 weeks)** |

**Buffer:** 1 week for bug fixes and polish  
**Total:** **7-8 weeks** (revised estimate)
