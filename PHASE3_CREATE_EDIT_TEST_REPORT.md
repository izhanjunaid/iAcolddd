---

## üß™ Test 1: Create Account (with Parent Selection)

### Test Scenario
Create a new "Inventory" account under "Current Assets" with an opening balance of $1000.

### Initial Attempt - FAILED ‚ùå
**Error:** `Root accounts must be of type CONTROL`

**Root Cause:** The form was missing a **Parent Account** selector, so all new accounts were created as root accounts. Detail accounts must have a parent.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `AccountSelector` import to `AccountsPage.tsx`
2. Added Parent Account dropdown to the form (line 260-279)
3. Dropdown shows only CONTROL and SUB_CONTROL accounts (DETAIL accounts filtered out)
4. Added helper text: "Leave blank for root account (must be CONTROL type)"

```typescript:260:279:frontend/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx
<div>
  <Label htmlFor="parentAccountId">Parent Account (optional)</Label>
  <select
    id="parentAccountId"
    {...register('parentAccountId')}
    className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-background px-3 py-2 text-sm"
  >
    <option value="">-- Root Account --</option>
    {accounts
      .filter(acc => acc.accountType !== 'DETAIL')
      .map(acc => (
        <option key={acc.id} value={acc.id}>
          {acc.code} - {acc.name}
        </option>
      ))}
  </select>
  <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-1">
    Leave blank for root account (must be CONTROL type)
  </p>
</div>
```

### Second Attempt - FAILED ‚ùå
**Error:** `Account code must contain only numbers and hyphens`

**Root Cause:** The form was sending an empty string for the `code` field instead of omitting it entirely, triggering backend validation.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `onSubmit` function to delete the `code` field if it's empty (line 98-101):

```typescript:86:113:frontend/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx
const onSubmit = async (data: AccountFormData) => {
  try {
    setError(null);
    
    // Prepare submit data
    const submitData = { ...data };
    
    if (editingAccount) {
      // When editing, remove code field (not allowed in update)
      delete submitData.code;
      await accountsService.updateAccount(editingAccount.id, submitData);
    } else {
      // When creating, remove empty code field so backend can auto-generate
      if (!submitData.code || submitData.code.trim() === '') {
        delete submitData.code;
      }
      await accountsService.createAccount(submitData as CreateAccountDto);
    }
    
    await loadAccounts();
    await loadAccountTree();
    setShowForm(false);
    setEditingAccount(null);
    reset();
  } catch (err: any) {
    setError(err.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to save account');
  }
};
```

### Third Attempt - SUCCESS ‚úÖ

**Form Data:**
- Account Name: `Inventory`
- Parent Account: `1-0001-0001 - Current Assets` (selected)
- Account Code: (left empty for auto-generation)
- Account Type: `DETAIL`
- Nature: `DEBIT`
- Category: `ASSET`
- Opening Balance: `1000.00`

**API Response:** `201 Created`

**Result in Database:**
```json
{
  "id": "auto-generated-uuid",
  "code": "1-0001-0001-0004",
  "name": "Inventory",
  "parentAccountId": "uuid-of-current-assets",
  "accountType": "DETAIL",
  "nature": "DEBIT",
  "category": "ASSET",
  "isActive": true,
  "isSystem": false,
  "openingBalance": "1000.00"
}
```

**Key Observations:**
- ‚úÖ Account code automatically generated as `1-0001-0001-0004` (hierarchical, following parent's code)
- ‚úÖ Opening balance correctly set to `1000.00`
- ‚úÖ Account appears in the list view immediately after creation
- ‚úÖ Edit and Delete buttons visible (account is not system account)
- ‚úÖ Form resets and closes after successful submission

---

## üß™ Test 2: Edit Account

### Test Scenario
Edit the newly created "Inventory" account to change the opening balance from $1000 to $2000.

### Initial Attempt - FAILED ‚ùå
**Error:** `property code should not exist`

**Root Cause:** When editing, the form was sending the `code` field (which is disabled in the UI) to the backend. The `UpdateAccountDto` doesn't allow code updates, as account codes cannot be changed after creation.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `onSubmit` function to always remove the `code` field when editing (line 94-96):

```typescript
if (editingAccount) {
  // When editing, remove code field (not allowed in update)
  delete submitData.code;
  await accountsService.updateAccount(editingAccount.id, submitData);
}
```

### Second Attempt - INCOMPLETE ‚è∏Ô∏è
**Status:** Backend server stopped responding before the update could be tested.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Form should submit successfully with updated opening balance
- Account list should refresh and show `2000.00` as the new opening balance
- Edit form should close after successful update

**Note:** Fix has been applied and is ready for testing when backend is restarted.

## üîß Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Missing Parent Account Selector
**Severity:** **CRITICAL** üî¥  
**Impact:** Users could not create child accounts (DETAIL, SUB_CONTROL)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Details:**
- The create/edit form was missing a way to select a parent account
- All new accounts were being created as root accounts
- This violated the business rule that only CONTROL accounts can be root accounts

**Fix:**
- Added parent account dropdown to the form
- Filtered to show only CONTROL and SUB_CONTROL accounts (valid parents)
- Added helper text to guide users
- Pre-selects current parent when editing

---

### Bug #2: Empty Code Field Sent to Backend
**Severity:** **MEDIUM** üü°  
**Impact:** Account creation failed with validation error  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Details:**
- React Hook Form was sending `code: ""` instead of omitting the field
- Backend validation rejected empty strings for the code field
- Auto-generation only works when the field is undefined/not present

**Fix:**
- Modified `onSubmit` to delete the code field if it's empty or whitespace-only
- Backend now receives no code field, triggering auto-generation logic

---

### Bug #3: Code Field Sent During Update
**Severity:** **MEDIUM** üü°  
**Impact:** Account updates failed with validation error  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Details:**
- The update API doesn't accept the `code` field (account codes are immutable)
- Form was sending the disabled code field value in the update request
- Backend validation rejected the request

**Fix:**
- Modified `onSubmit` to always delete the code field when editing
- Separate logic for create vs. update operations

3. **Code Preview** - Show predicted account code in real-time as user selects parent
4. **Batch Account Creation** - Consider allowing CSV import for bulk account setup

### For Testing
1. **Automated Tests** - Consider adding Playwright tests for CRUD operations
2. **Edge Cases** - Test maximum hierarchy depth (e.g., 5+ levels)
3. **Performance** - Test with 1000+ accounts to ensure scalability
4. **Concurrent Updates** - Test multiple users editing same account
