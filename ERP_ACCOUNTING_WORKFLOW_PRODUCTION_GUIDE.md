## System Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced indexing and constraints
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **API**: RESTful APIs with comprehensive documentation
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (separate deployment)

### Core Principles
- **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**: Every transaction affects at least two accounts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all changes and user actions
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and business rule validation
- **Security**: Role-based permissions and encrypted data transmission
- **Scalability**: Designed for enterprise-level transaction volumes

---

## Core Accounting Modules

### 1. Chart of Accounts Management
**Purpose**: Foundation of all financial transactions

**Key Features**:
- Hierarchical account structure (CONTROL → SUB_CONTROL → DETAIL)
- Automatic account code generation
- Account nature classification (DEBIT/CREDIT)
- Account categories (ASSET, LIABILITY, EQUITY, REVENUE, EXPENSE)
- Parent-child relationships with circular reference prevention

**Production Workflow**:
1. **Account Creation**: System administrators create root CONTROL accounts
2. **Sub-Account Setup**: Managers create SUB_CONTROL and DETAIL accounts
3. **Code Generation**: Automatic sequential numbering (e.g., 1-0001, 1-0002)
4. **Validation**: Business rules prevent invalid account structures
5. **Activation**: Accounts become available for transactions

### 2. Voucher Management System
**Purpose**: Core transaction processing engine

**Voucher Types**:
- **Journal Vouchers (JV)**: General accounting entries
- **Payment Vouchers (PV)**: Cash/bank payments
- **Receipt Vouchers (RV)**: Cash/bank receipts

**Production Workflow**:
1. **Voucher Creation**: Authorized users create vouchers
2. **Line Item Entry**: Debit and credit entries with validation
3. **Balance Verification**: System ensures total debits = total credits
4. **Approval Process**: Multi-level approval for high-value transactions
5. **Posting**: Final posting makes transactions permanent
6. **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all changes

### 3. General Ledger Operations
**Purpose**: Real-time financial data management

**Key Features**:
- Real-time balance calculations
- Account ledger generation
- Trial balance preparation
- Financial statement data aggregation

## General Ledger Operations

### 1. Account Balance Calculation
**Real-time Balance Formula**:
```
For DEBIT Nature Accounts:
Current Balance = Opening Balance + Total Debits - Total Credits

For CREDIT Nature Accounts:
Current Balance = Opening Balance + Total Credits - Total Debits
```

### 2. Account Ledger Generation
**Features**:
- Chronological transaction listing
- Running balance calculation
- Voucher reference tracking
- Date range filtering

**Sample Ledger Entry**:
```
Account: Cash in Hand (1-0001-0001)
Period: January 1-31, 2025

Date       | Voucher No | Description           | Debit    | Credit   | Balance
2025-01-01 | Opening    | Opening Balance       |          |          | 10,000.00 DR
2025-01-15 | RV-0001    | Customer Payment      | 5,000.00 |          | 15,000.00 DR
2025-01-20 | PV-0001    | Office Rent Payment   |          | 2,000.00 | 13,000.00 DR
2025-01-31 | Closing    | Month End Balance     |          |          | 13,000.00 DR
```

### 3. Trial Balance Generation
**Purpose**: Verify accounting equation balance
**Formula**: Total Debits = Total Credits

**Sample Trial Balance**:
```
Account Code | Account Name           | Debit Balance | Credit Balance
1-0001-0001 | Cash in Hand           | 13,000.00     |
1-0001-0002 | Bank Account - ABC      | 25,000.00     |
1-0001-0003 | Accounts Receivable     | 8,000.00      |
2-0001-0001 | Accounts Payable        |               | 12,000.00
3-0001-0001 | Owner's Capital         |               | 30,000.00
4-0001-0001 | Sales Revenue           |               | 15,000.00
5-0001-0001 | Operating Expenses      | 7,000.00      |
             | TOTAL                  | 53,000.00     | 57,000.00
             | DIFFERENCE             | 4,000.00      |
