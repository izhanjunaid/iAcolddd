## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Opening Balance Display Error
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

**Description:**  
Frontend crashed when trying to display opening balances. Error: `TypeError: account.openingBalance.toFixed is not a function`

**Root Cause:**  
PostgreSQL NUMERIC type is serialized as a string by TypeORM to preserve precision. The frontend was calling `.toFixed()` directly on the string value.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (Line 348)
<TableCell>{account.openingBalance.toFixed(2)}</TableCell>

// After
<TableCell>{Number(account.openingBalance).toFixed(2)}</TableCell>
```

**Verification:**  
All opening balances now display correctly as `0.00`.

- [x] Hierarchical account code generation
- [x] List view display
- [x] Tree view display
- [x] Edit account form
- [x] Form validation
- [x] System account protection
- [x] Permission-based access control

### API Endpoints Tested:

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Investigate "Add Account" Button Issue**
   - Playwright click timeout issue
   - May need to check z-index or overlay blocking
   - Manual testing should verify if this is a test issue or UI bug

2. **Complete CRUD Testing**
   - Test account creation with auto-generated code
   - Test account update (submit form)
   - Test account deletion with hierarchy validation
   - Test opening balance calculation

3. **Additional Test Scenarios**
   - Parent account selection validation
   - Duplicate account code prevention
   - Delete account with children (should fail)
   - Inactive account filtering
   - Search/filter functionality

### Phase 4 Preparation:
- Review Vouchers module requirements
- Plan integration between Vouchers and Accounts (account selection)
- Prepare for journal entry system
- Design voucher approval workflow
